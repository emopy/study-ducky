This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

A Flask based API backend was added in the *api* directory.

## Setup
If on Linux/MacOS:
```
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```
Otherwise, follow code in Bash script.

Afterwards, to start the app, in two different terminals:
```
# Start the React server on localhost:3000
yarn start
# Start the Flask server on localhost:5000
yarn start-api
```
